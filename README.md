This is an Android Studio project that built an Android app using the Webview template by Slymax. 
This app asks the user to input the morning line odds of the horses in the field separated by commas and then enter the Toteboard odds of the horses in the field separated by commas.
Both sets of odds must be input and converted from fractions to decimals.  Fore example an odds of "6/5" would be input as "1.2".
The app will give the best suggested exacta box wagers for the users (For entertainment purposes only). The numbers that appear are the number corresponding to the entry list order of the Morning Line and Toteboard odds.  If a horse was scratched, that needs to be taken into account by the USER.
